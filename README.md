# Introduction to Deep Learning with PyTorch

Welcome to my GitHub repository showcasing my journey and projects from the "Introduction to Deep Learning with PyTorch" course on Udacity.

## About the Course

This Udacity course provided a comprehensive introduction to deep learning using the PyTorch framework. I delved into fundamental concepts, practical applications, and gained hands-on experience in building and training deep neural networks.

### Course Topics

Throughout the course, I covered key topics, including:

- **Introduction to Deep Learning**: Understanding the fundamentals of deep learning and its applications.
- **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**: Exploring CNNs for image classification tasks.
- **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)**: Learning how RNNs are used for sequential data, such as text or time series.

## Projects

As part of the course, I completed practical projects to apply my knowledge. Here are a couple of projects I worked on:

1. **Handwritten Digits Classifier with PyTorch**:
   - Developed a deep learning model to classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset.
   - Applied convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for image recognition.

2. **Fashion-MNIST Classification**:
   - Built a deep learning model to classify fashion items from the Fashion-MNIST dataset.
   - Gained experience in image classification using PyTorch.

## Next Steps

With the skills and knowledge acquired from this course, I am well-equipped to explore deeper into the field of deep learning and PyTorch. My GitHub repository will serve as a foundation for future deep learning projects and experiments.

Thank you for joining me on this learning journey. If you have any questions or would like to connect, please feel free to reach out. Let's continue to explore the exciting world of deep learning together!

Happy coding!
